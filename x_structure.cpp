/*
A struct is a collection of one or more variables 
grouped together under a single name.

The data elements in a structure are known as its 
member variables, which can be of different types.

Once a structure type is defined, its structure name 
can be used to declare variables of this structure type

A struct can have multiple constructors as follows:
struct Student {
    char* name;
    char* id;
    int age;
    Student(char* nm, char* d, int a) {
        name = nm;
        id = d;
        age = a;
    }
    Student(char* nm, char* d) {
        name = nm;
        id = d;
    }
    Student(char* nm) {
        name = nm;
    }
}
We call this overloading (functions having the same name but different parameter lists)
