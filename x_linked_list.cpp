A fundamental data structure.

Allow insertion and removal of items (struct) at any 
point in the list in constant time (efficient).

Make use of the concepts of structure (struct), 
pointers (*ptr) and dynamic variable allocation (new).

A NULL pointer is assigned the pointer variable of the 
last node to indicate the end of the linked list.
